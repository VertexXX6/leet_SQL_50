# Write your MySQL query statement below

-- problem :  report the customer ids from the Customer table that bought all the products in the Product table.
-- my approach :
-- 1. Get the total number of products from the Product table using COUNT(*).
-- 2. Look at the Purchase table (customer_id, product_id) and GROUP BY customer_id.
-- 3. For each customer, COUNT(DISTINCT product_id) to see how many unique products they bought.
-- 4. Compare that count with the total count of products (subquery).
-- 5. If both counts match â†’ that customer bought all products.

select customer_id  
from Customer group by 
customer_id  
having count(distinct product_key)= (select count(*) from Product);
