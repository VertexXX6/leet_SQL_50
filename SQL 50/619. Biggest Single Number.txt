# Write your MySQL query statement below
 -- Problem:
-- We need to find the largest single number from the table MyNumbers.
-- A "single number" is a number that appears only once in the table.
-- If there is no such number, we should return NULL.

-- Approach:
-- 1. Use GROUP BY with HAVING COUNT(*) = 1 to filter only the single numbers.
-- 2. Order the result in descending order to get the largest single number first.
-- 3. Apply LIMIT 1 to return only the biggest single number.
-- 4. Wrap the subquery with IFNULL(..., NULL) so that if no single numbers exist,
--    the query returns NULL instead of an empty result.

select ifnull((select num 
from MyNumbers 
group by num  
having count(*)=1 
order by num desc
limit 1 ) ,null) as num;
