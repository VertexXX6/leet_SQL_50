# Write your MySQL query statement below
-- problem : 
-- find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively. 
-- A user was active on someday if they made at least one activity on that day.

-- approach : 
-- 1. filter the records where activity_date is between '2019-06-28' and '2019-07-27'.
-- 2. select activity_date as the day.
-- 3. count distinct user_id for each day to avoid duplicates of the same user.
-- 4. group by activity_date to get the result day by day.
-- 5. rename columns with aliases (day, active_users).

-- note : 
-- - if you use an aggregate function (like count) together with another column in select, 
--   then you must group by that column. 
-- - days with no activity will not appear in the result (which is expected).
-- - always use distinct to make sure the same user is not counted multiple times in the same day.
-- - remember to use single quotes for dates in the between condition.

select activity_date as day , count(distinct user_id ) as active_users
from Activity 
where activity_date between '2019-06-28' and '2019-07-27'
