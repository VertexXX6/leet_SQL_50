Problem:
Write a SQL query to find all sales that occurred in the first year each product was sold.

- For each product_id, identify the earliest year it appears in the Sales table.
- Return all sales entries for that product in that year.
- The output should include: product_id, first_year, quantity, and price.
- The result can be returned in any order.

Approach:
1. Use a subquery to get the minimum year (first_year) for each product_id.
2. Match each product_id and its first_year with the Sales table.
3. Return product_id, first_year, quantity, and price for those matched rows.

SELECT product_id , year AS first_year , quantity , price 
FROM Sales 
WHERE (product_id,year) IN (SELECT product_id ,MIN(year)
FROM Sales 
GROUP BY product_id  );
